
Tips for avoiding an information bubble

- Clear your search history on Google.
	Google knows a lot about you just from your web history, and that info is used
to help decide what results you get from a google search.

- Delete and turn off cookies on your browser.
	Cookies are data that your web browser stores when you are on a web site. 
Other sites can see what you have looked at and use that info to decide what to show 
you next unless you turn off the permission to do so in your browser's settings.

- Turn off targeted ads in your browser.
	Your web browser should have the option, or and extention which enables
you to turn off targeted ads.

- Keep social media data private, and hide your birthday.
	Facebook can make changes that cause private data to become public data.
Completely stopping this is un-doable. However, there are ways to mitigate it.
Adjust privacy settings in "Basic Privacy Settings & Tools and to turn off 
"Instant Personalization." If you show your birthday, at least dont enter your year
to make it harder for ad companies to identify you.

- Use an 'incognito'/'anonymous' browser.
	Even just personalizing your web browser gives websites info about you. Stop
this by using default settings. Or, in google chrome, use incognito browsing. There
is also DuckDuckGo.com which is a browser that doesn't trach your history and is 
private. Torproject.org has downloadable software for free. Their software allows you to be
completely anonymous by hiding your location and IP address. Private browsing in most search
engines will still use your location and IP address to influence search results.

- Use a VPN.
	A VPN(Virtual Private Network) is an extreme and more advanced option for 
avoiding an information bubble, but is very effective.
