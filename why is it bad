Why is bad?
Person living in Information bubble gets intellectually isolated from the rest of the world. His view is being bended and cannot be objective anymore in regards to particular issue. Eventually being isolated from other important events occuring in meantime.
If it keeps ongoing then we will have a person disconnected from society often not being aware of that. Once you start living in this bubble you are connecting via technology with people like you and do not have opportunity to exercise your intelligence by having a meaningful conversation with people on opposite side with different views. You don’t have to bring arguments and samples supporting your statements, you don’t have to see other points of view because you know everyone thinks like you and agrees on the issue. With time you become so secure in your bubble that you start accepting only that info that fits your opinion(regardless of being true or not) instead of basing your opinion on evidence that is out there. And here is the moment where some entities may use it for their purpose, either to fight their wars or purchase their product or even win election. That’s how you could get manipulated.
If you are aware of it than you realized that it’s ceasing your freedom. 
Yes, it has a short term benefits like saving your time when you shop or pointing things you could be interested in. It shields you from all the unwanted info making your life very happy, creates vision of “everyone singing the same song” and being united.
However for long term its harmful to you and society. Being isolated from everything. Not only from different points of views, unwanted adds but also from new ideas, subjects, important info.
