	<h1>Information Bubbles and Limited Perspectives</h1>

	<h2>What is the Information Bubble?</h2>

	<p>I bought a mattress on sale. What happened in the following weeks surprised me: I constantly received multiple adds of attractive mattresses. What are they thinking? I need another mattress to put on top of my new one? The same thing happened when I bought a suitcase: it seems all of a sudden all the American luggage companies earnestly want me to buy some more. I immediately became puzzled on how they could get such information, until my teammates brought a word to me: Filter Bubble. Then I started to understand the force behind these strange comercial behaviors.</p> 
 
	<p>The filter bubble is an intelligent outcome of the search engine, the personalized filter gatekeepers and editors, based on the idea that what you click on first is getting more and more attention. According to  Wikipedia the nature of it is  “a state of intellectual isolation” which comes from “personalized searches”, and the cause of it is ”a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user”. It seems the searching engines have ability to spy on you, have the intelligence to collect data as information, and have character of pleasing you by offering you only those things you want to see.</p> 
 
	<p>Can the filter bubble can be seen as intellectual isolation? Just think if you could only be fed the information of what you like to hear, want to see and expect to have.  Would you be enclosed by self-satisfaction? Could you be separated from what disagrees with your viewpoints? So professionals conclude: these algorithms results in intellectual isolation.</p>

	<p>Pierre-Nicolas Schwab (Citation) distinguishes filter bubbles into four different types by perspective of how they are created: 
		<ol>
			<li>The one created by audience measurement</li>
	  	<li>The one created by hyperlinks</li>
	  	<li>The one created by social gatekeepers (or "influencers")</li> 
	  	<li>And the one created by our own behavior</li> 
	  </ol>
	 </p>

	<p>No matter how the filter bubble formed, it brought to us a severe fact: The hidden web is trying hard to shape our lives by working on “our future selves and the present selves”. On one hand we need internet connect us, on the other hand, could we allow it lead to the cultural and intellectual isolation and finally we’ll lose the status of being free?   It is good thing that people started paying attention on filter bubbles, which could be the way of intellectual isolation towards people, even worse, could become the tool of mind control as well as misleading ideology.</p> 


	<h2>Ok, I get it, but why should I care?</h2>

	<p>
		People living in information bubbles get intellectually isolated from the rest of the world. Their views is being bended and cannot be objective anymore in regards to particular issue. Eventually being isolated from other important events occuring in meantime.
		If it keeps ongoing then we will have a person disconnected from society often not being aware of that. According to Deanley “Technology such as social media “lets you go off with like-minded people, so you’re not mixing and sharing and understanding other points of view,” said Bill Gates in a recent interview with Quartz”.</p>
		
		<p> Once you start living in this bubble you are connecting via technology with people like you and do not have as much opportunity to exercise your intelligence by having a meaningful conversation with people on who have different views. You don’t have to bring arguments and samples supporting your statements, you don’t have to see other points of view because you know everyone thinks like you and agrees on the issue. With time you become so secure in your bubble that you start accepting only that info that fits your opinion (regardless of being true or not) instead of basing your opinion on evidence that is out there. And here is the moment where some entities may use it for their purpose; from fighting their wars to purchasing their products or even winning elections. That’s how you could get manipulated.
		If you are aware of it than you realized that it is limiting your freedom. 
		Yes, it has a short term benefits like saving you time when you shop or pointing to things you could be interested in. It shields you from all the unwanted info making your life very happy, and creates a vision of “everyone singing the same song” and being united.
		However, in the long term its harmful to you and society. It isolates you from different points of views, unwanted adds but also from new ideas, subjects, and important info.

	<h2>OMG!!! THAT SOUNDS BAD!! How can I avoid that???</h2>
	<p>
		<h3>Tips for avoiding an information bubble</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Clear your search history on Google.
				Google knows a lot about you just from your web history, and that info is used
				to help decide what results you get from a google search.</li>
				<li>Delete and turn off cookies on your browser.
				Cookies are data that your web browser stores when you are on a web site. 
				Other sites can see what you have looked at and use that info to decide what to show 
				you next unless you turn off the permission to do so in your browser's settings.</li>
				<li>Turn off targeted ads in your browser.
				Your web browser should have the option, or and extention which enables
				you to turn off targeted ads.</li>
				<li>Keep social media data private, and hide your birthday.
				Facebook can make changes that cause private data to become public data.
				Completely stopping this is un-doable. However, there are ways to mitigate it.
				Adjust privacy settings in "Basic Privacy Settings & Tools and to turn off 
				"Instant Personalization." If you show your birthday, at least dont enter your year
				to make it harder for ad companies to identify you.</li>
				<li>Use an 'incognito'/'anonymous' browser.
				Even just personalizing your web browser gives websites info about you. Stop
				this by using default settings. Or, in google chrome, use incognito browsing. There
				is also DuckDuckGo.com which is a browser that doesn't trach your history and is 
				private. Torproject.org has downloadable software for free. Their software allows you to be
				completely anonymous by hiding your location and IP address. Private browsing in most search
				engines will still use your location and IP address to influence search results.</li>
				<li>Use a VPN. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is an extreme and more advanced option for 
				avoiding an information bubble, but is very effective.</li>
